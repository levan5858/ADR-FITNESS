          <h3>From Romania to the UK</h3>
          <p>Originally from Romania, Andrei moved to the United Kingdom with his family. At age 17, he began his fitness journey, transforming from facing weight issues and bullying to becoming a dedicated athlete. His early struggles became the foundation for his relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
          <p>Through disciplined training, nutritional precision, and unwavering consistency, Andrei developed the systems that would later define ADR Fitness—a gym brand co-founded with his business partner, primarily showcasing Andrei's proven methods and journey.</p>

          <h3>The ADR Fitness standard</h3>
          <p>ADR Fitness is a premium gym brand co-founded by Andrei Deiu and his business partner. While the brand represents a collaborative vision, it primarily highlights Andrei's IFBB Pro-level training methods, competition experience, and the "3D Gains" program he developed.</p>
          <p>Every program is guided by Andrei's mantra: execute with intent, recover with care, and keep the standard. Health is Wealth—the through-line that connects every aspect of the ADR experience.</p>
