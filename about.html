His early struggles became the foundation for his relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
          <p>Through disciplined training, nutritional precision, and unwavering consistency, Andrei developed the systems that would later define ADR Fitness—a gym brand co-founded with Roseanne Deiu, primarily showcasing Andrei's proven methods and journey.</p>

          <h3>Proven IFBB Pro Methodology</h3>
          <p>Train with systems that earned Andrei Deiu his IFBB Pro card at the 2017 Amateur Olympia. Every program, exercise selection, and training split is based on methods proven on the world's most competitive stages. This isn't generic fitness—it's championship-level training adapted for your goals.</p>
          <p>Andrei's "3D Gains" philosophy focuses on muscle depth, detail, and density—the three pillars that separate professional physiques from amateur results. You'll train with the same precision, periodization, and attention to detail that built an Olympia-level competitor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card glass">
          <h3>From Struggle to Success</h3>
          <p>Andrei's journey began at 17, overcoming weight issues, bullying, and self-doubt to become an IFBB Pro. This transformation wasn't just physical—it was mental, emotional, and spiritual. At ADR Fitness, you're not just training with a champion; you're learning from someone who's navigated every obstacle on the path to excellence.</p>
          <p>This lived experience translates to authentic coaching. Andrei understands setbacks, plateaus, and the daily grind because he's lived it. Every motivational moment, every technical correction, comes from genuine empathy and expertise.</p>

          <h3>Elite Industry Partnerships</h3>
          <p>As a Team Evogen Elite athlete and ProSupps ambassador, Andrei has access to cutting-edge nutrition science, recovery protocols, and supplement innovations that most coaches can only read about. This industry insider knowledge directly benefits ADR members through optimized supplementation strategies and recovery protocols.</p>
          <p>You'll train with programs influenced by Hany Rambod's FST-7 principles, Evogen's elite nutrition protocols, and the latest in sports science—all integrated into a system that works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card glass">
          <h3>Precision Over Hype</h3>
          <p>In an industry filled with quick-fix promises and influencer marketing, ADR Fitness offers substance. Every training phase is periodized. Every nutrition plan is macronutrient-specific. Every recovery protocol is science-backed. This is the difference between getting "fit" and building a physique that turns heads.</p>
          <p>Whether you're preparing for competition, transforming your body composition, or simply seeking the highest standard of training, ADR Fitness delivers results through systematic excellence, not shortcuts.</p>

        <h3>A Holistic Approach to Excellence</h3>
        <p>ADR Fitness isn't just about lifting weights or building muscle—it's about cultivating a lifestyle where health becomes your greatest asset. "Health is Wealth" isn't marketing; it's the foundational principle that guided Andrei from struggling teenager to IFBB Pro.</p>
        <p>This philosophy manifests in:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Training Excellence:</strong> Periodized programs that progress you systematically toward your goals, whether that's strength, size, conditioning, or competition prep.</li>
          <li><strong>Nutritional Precision:</strong> Macronutrient tracking, meal timing, and supplementation strategies that support optimal performance and recovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery Protocols:</strong> Sleep optimization, stress management, and active recovery methods that ensure you're building, not breaking down.</li>
          <li><strong>Mental Fortitude:</strong> The discipline, consistency, and mindset required to sustain long-term transformation.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Training alongside individuals committed to the same standard of excellence, creating accountability and motivation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you train at ADR Fitness, you're investing in more than a gym membership—you're investing in a system that transforms your body, elevates your performance, and enriches your life. You're investing in health as wealth.</p>
